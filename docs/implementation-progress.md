# Implementation Progress

## Iteration 01 â€” Playable core loop slice

- Created a mobile-friendly Math Marauders prototype covering forward gates, skirmish resolution, and reverse chase survival.
- Added deterministic math modules (gate generation, skirmish, reverse attrition) with Jest coverage to keep combat tuning transparent.
- Wired HUD polish, persistence, and pause/restart flows to match the arcade pacing outlined in the main spec.
- Open questions: extend multi-wave progression, add cinematic transitions once 3D track rendering lands, explore difficulty scaling for seeds.
