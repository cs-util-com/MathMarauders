# Implementation Progress

## Iteration 01 â€” Prototype Loop Assembly

feat(core): stitch forward run, skirmish, reverse chase, and HUD [#iteration-01]

- Delivered the static web prototype with forward-run gate selection, deterministic skirmish resolution, reverse chase pressure, and star-rated end card.
- Added performance guard rails (auto FX downgrade) plus pause drawer with resume/restart/mute/effects toggles and steering slider readout.
- Implemented seeded gate generation, scoring, and formatting utilities with accompanying unit + property tests.
- Open questions: extend gates beyond three decisions, surface chase replay data in HUD, and integrate actual low-poly renders when art pipeline lands.
- Next iteration: expose wave progression tuning, expand chase difficulty bands, and wire optional auto-restart for high-score hunting.
